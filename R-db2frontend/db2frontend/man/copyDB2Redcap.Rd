\title{Copy Database Content to REDCap}
\usage{
copyDB2Redcap()
}
\value{
Invisible. The function is called for its side effects: importing data
into REDCap and does not return a value.
}
\description{
This function retrieves data from a specific patient view or table in a database
(defined in the schema \verb{_out}) and imports this data into a REDCap project.
It establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database, fetches relevant patient data,
then connects to a REDCap project using API credentials and imports the data.
}
\details{
Note: Database and REDCap connection details (e.g., credentials, table names) are
required to be predefined or passed as arguments (not included in this example for
security reasons).
}
\examples{
# Before using this function, ensure that variables `dbname`, `dbhost`, `dbport`,
# `dbfrontenduser`, `dbfrontendpassword`, `dbfrontendoptionsout`, `url`, and `token`
# are correctly set up with your database and REDCap project details.
# This is a placeholder example and won't run without proper setup:
# copyDB2Redcap()
