# These parameters can set additional FHIR-search parameters for downloading Requests. It is possible
# to set parameters for each FHIR resource or set specific parameters for all FHIR resources with the
# parameter DEBUG_ADD_FHIR_SEARCH_GENERAL. Several parameters can be customised by linking the FHIR
# search parameters with an '&'. If the parameter is set to an empty string "", then the resource is
# not downloaded.
#
# ATTENTION: Which specific FHIR search requests result from the following DEBUG_ADD_FHIR_SEARCH
# ---------- parameters depends on the FHIR server and can only be predicted to a limited extent!
#            Invalid parameters are (possibly) simply ignored and the order of the parameters is
#            almost always adjusted. You can see the result of the requests in the file
#            'outputLocal/cds2db/bundles/cds2db_total_bundles.txt'.
